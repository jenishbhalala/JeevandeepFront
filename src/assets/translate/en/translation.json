    "about_jeevandeep": "Jeevandepp Foundation is a not-for-profit, non-governmental organization started to promote organ donation in 2022 in surat by philanthropists and medical professionals led by Piyush Gondaliya. It is a registered NGO with Income Tax exemption under Section 80G and 35AC. JEEVANDEEP Foundation was started by a group of like-minded and concerned medical and non-medical professionals committed to increasing the reach of the Transplantation of Human Organs Act. The Government of India passed this act in 1994 to broaden the concept of organ donation and stop commercial dealings in organs, especially kidneys. It is now possible to not only donate one’s eyes, but also other vital organs like the heart, lungs, liver, pancreas and kidneys."
